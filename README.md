# falling-blocks-game
This repository contains the code of the falling blocks game in p5js. The objective is to enhance the features of the game.
The falling blocks follow poisson distribution, to have some expected number of blocks fall per frame. Some constant gravity
is included in the game play. Initial speeds of the falling objects are in a particular range and the upper level of this range
increases with each level. With each level, the expectation of the poisson distribution is also increased. The game is
